Singletons
When you're developing applications, you will often create multiple instances of objects. For example, you may have a Sandwich object which contains an ingredients property. For the different types of sandwiches, you will have an instance representing the sandwich.

While multiple instances are important, there are sometimes concepts that you will need to represent in code where only one instance should exist. This is the purpose of a Singleton.

Singletons are a code design pattern whereby only one instance of a type of object can exist.

For example, when developing the Little Lemon app, you might need to create a class named Company to represent the business as a whole. Since there is only one Little Lemon company, there should not be multiple instances of the company in your app, therefore, you would make the Company class a singleton.

In Kotlin, the singleton pattern can be implemented using the object keyword. In the example below, the Company class is defined as a singleton.

1234
object Company {
    
}

Note how the object keyword is used instead of the class keyword to define the class.

Once, the singleton is defined, you can add properties and functions like any other class. The example below shows two properties added to the singleton; companyName and yearOpened. There is also a function called getTotalYearsOpen which returns how many years the Little Lemon has been opened.


import java.util.*;

object Company {
    var companyName: String = "Little Lemon"
    var yearOpened: Int = 2019
    
    fun getTotalYearsOpen() : Int {
        return Calendar.getInstance().get(Calendar.YEAR) - yearOpened;
    }
}

The key difference in using this class, is that functions and properties will be accessed statically; no instance of the class can be created.

For example, if you wanted to print out how many years the Little Lemon was open, you would use the following code:

1
println(Company.getTotalYearsOpen());
Note that the class name is used instead of an instance variable to call the function.      

Singletons are an important tool in your development toolkit. Knowing when to use them takes practice but as you progress in your development career, you will easily be able to identify opportunities to use Singletons.

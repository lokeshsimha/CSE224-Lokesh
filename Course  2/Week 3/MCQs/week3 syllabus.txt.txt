Week 3: Functional programming
Next, you will learn about  Lambda expressions,  Function types,  Higher-order functions and collections processing. You'll explore how functions can be used as objects, use lambda expressions to define functions as objects and define and use higher-order and repeat functions. Finally you'll explore using collection processing methods for multistep collection processing.    

After completing the lesson items, you will be able to:

Explain what functional programming is and why it is useful.

Read and define a function type.

Use a lambda expression to define a function as an object.

Define a function that takes a function as an argument.

Use collection processing functions to process collections in different ways.

Use collection processing methods for multistep collection processing.
